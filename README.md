# The Mumuki Platform

Hi there! You are at the root repository of the **Mumuki Platform**, the _libre_ open-source platform of the [Mumuki Project](http://mumuki.org). This is the entry point for everyone who wants to report an issue, suggest an enhancement or start a discussion about any aspect of the platform. We accept issues both in English and Spanish, please check our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/mumuki/mumuki-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further information.

The platform is a web-based coding tool that provides automatic formative assessment, fully developed in Argentina. The platform aims to provide assistance for teachers and students, in a process conduced by practice where theory arises from the exercises. It supports a wide range of programming languages, from Haskell or Prolog to Python or C, and automatic feedback can be provided for all of them. An online, fully-functional sample of the platform can be visited at http://mumuki.io.
